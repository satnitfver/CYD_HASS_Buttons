# ESP32 CYD (Cheap Yellow Display) Touchscreen MQTT Button Panel

This project transforms an ESP32 with a CYD touchscreen into a customizable MQTT button panel. It allows you to trigger MQTT messages by touching virtual buttons on the display, making it ideal for home automation, IoT control, or interactive interfaces.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Customizable Buttons:** Define multiple virtual buttons with specific labels, colors, and positions.
* **MQTT Integration:** Publishes messages to pre-defined MQTT topics when buttons are pressed.
* **WiFi Connectivity:** Connects to your local WiFi network.
* **TFT Display Support:** Utilizes a TFT_eSPI compatible display for crisp visuals.
* **XPT2046 Touchscreen Support:** Detects touch inputs for interactive control.
* **Deep Sleep Mode:** Enters a low-power deep sleep state after a period of inactivity to conserve energy, waking up on touch.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Before uploading the code, you need to modify the `CONFIG` section with your network and MQTT server details.

```cpp
// ---------------- CONFIG ----------------

const char* ssid = "YOUR_WIFI_SSID";          // Your WiFi network name
const char* password = "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD";  // Your WiFi network password
const char* mqtt_server = "YOUR_MQTT_BROKER_IP"; // IP address or hostname of your MQTT broker
const char* MyHostName = "esp32-button-panel"; // Optional: A hostname for your ESP32 on the network
